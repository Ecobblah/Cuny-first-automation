# Students Class and GPS info(for school)
It reads the original txt document, stores the Students name, classes, class credit, total number of credits and GPA.
Once that done it will ask the user for First, last Name, Student ID, and Class. This will continue until we answer no  "we dont want to add another student".
That will be the end of the program and the output will be in the Org document with the new Students.
The reason for -999 so my program will know when to store Total number of credits and overall GPA.

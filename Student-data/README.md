#Students Class and GPS info
What it does, it reads the orginal txt document, stores the Students name, classes, class credit, total numer of credits and GPA.
Once that done it will Ask the user for First and last Name Student ID,Class...till it ask if we want to add another student yes/no
Then that when the program will end and presents you with the new students with the old student in the Org document into the NEw document.
THe point of -999 so my program is reading the Org document it will know when to store Total number of credits and overall GPA.

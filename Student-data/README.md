#Students Class and GPS info(for school)
What it does, it reads the original txt document, stores the Students name, classes, class credit, total number of credits and GPA.
Once that done it will ask the user for First and last Name Student ID, Class...till it ask if we want to add another student yes/no.
Then that will be the end of the program and outputs you the new students with the old student in the Org document into the New document.
The point of -999 so my program will know when to store Total number of credits and overall GPA.

#Overall
If i were to make the program for myself, i would make a GUI to make it look nice and use maybe SQL to store all the data that is need and maybe make it a Web application.

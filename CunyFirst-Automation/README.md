This is an Automation program that automates every hour checking cunyfirst if a class is full. If the class is available 
it will take a seat for you and swap (need to comment out the swap) end the program and print out in the text field congrats!.

WARNING:  I'm not responsible if it messes up your schedule by any possible way. My Program never comes close to 
a delete button for a class, but things happen so becareful.

Problems i haven't fixed yet
1. If you enter the wrong password the program will crash.
2. I never asked the user how many classes in the shopping cart, So the default value is 1 "P_SELECT$0" class. Plan on using an array for this. When user
    has N classes in the shopping cart ill use a for loop with an array that has "P_SELECT$100"
3. This Program Will Also swap Classes, so i need to make it a option for the user.
5. Once you get into at least one class the programs ends without continuing enrolling your other classes. One class at a time.
4. The GUI Interface positioning is off.
